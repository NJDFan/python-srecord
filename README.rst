========================
Srecord tools for Python
========================

These allow the writing of simple Python programs to move chunks
of binary data around, for the purpose of building ROM images.

See the extensive docstring at the start of __init.py__ for
all the meaningful information.

This runs on Python 2.6+, with nothing other than the standard
libary installed.  Unit tests are included in test.py, and can be
executed from one level above here with the command

	python -m unittest srecord.test
